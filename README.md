# About The Repo

This project is the practicle demonstration of what react portals are. Here I am using two real life use cases i.e. modals and tooltips to show how we can leverage react portals in real life projects. I explained this in detial in my article which can be found on [https://medium.com](https://medium.com/@zafarsaleem/how-to-use-react-portals-using-real-life-use-cases-b903643c8f78).
