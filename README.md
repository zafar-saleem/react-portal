# Getting Started with Create React App

# About The Repo

This project is the practicle demonstration of what react portals are. Here I am using two real life use cases i.e. modals and tooltips to show how we can leverage react portals in real life projects. I explained this in detial in my article which can be found [here](https://www.webwinx.com/2023/02/09/how-to-use-react-portals-using-real-life-usecases/).

## Running The Project

```bash
yarn start
```
